=======
This is the Java version of my Tic-Tac-Toe game. It supports both Human and AI players. The AI is unbeatable and uses a minimax algorithm to calculate its moves.

To play in the terminal, follow these steps:

1) Clone this repository and cd into it

2) from the project's root directory, type: java javattt/GameLoop
